# Turning Tables


This repository contains the code accompanying the paper:

**"Turning Tables: Generating Examples from Semi-structured Tables for Endowing Language Models with Reasoning Skills"** [[Preprint]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.07261)

### Structure
The repository contains:
* Implementation and instructions for generating reasoning examples from semi-structured tables in the `ExampleGeneration` directory.
* Implementation and instructions for training and fine-tuning PReasM in the `Training` directory.
* The generated examples and models described in the paper are publicly avaialble. See `ExampleGeneration` to download the generated examples and `Training` to download the PReasM models.
